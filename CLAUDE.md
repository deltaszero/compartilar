# CompartiLar Development Guidelines

## Build Commands
- `npm run dev` - Run development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run local` - Run development server accessible from other devices on network
- `firebase emulators:start` - Run Firebase emulators locally for testing
- `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` - Deploy Firestore security rules
- `firebase deploy --only storage:rules` - Deploy Storage rules
- `firebase deploy --only hosting` - Deploy the application to Firebase Hosting

## Code Style & Conventions
- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing with proper interfaces/types; define shared types in `/types/` directory
- **Components**: Use React functional components with hooks; follow separation of concerns
- **Firebase**: Follow `collection/document/subcollection` pattern; prefer subcollections over root collections
- **Imports Order**: React/Next.js core, Firebase, external libraries, internal components, types, styles
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions, snake_case for Firebase collections
- **CSS**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes; consistent color scheme using design system variables
- **Formatting**: 2-space indentation, single quotes for strings, semicolons at end of statements
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch for Firebase operations with proper console.error and user-facing toast messages
- **Performance**: Optimize Firebase queries with proper indexes; use Firestore listeners wisely
- **Security**: Follow the permission model with viewers/editors arrays in child documents

## Testing & Debugging
- Add `console.log()` statements strategically with descriptive prefixes for different modules
- Use Firebase Emulator for local testing with `firebase emulators:start`
- Check browser console and Firebase logs for authentication and Firestore errors
- Add delay after authentication operations: `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))`
- Refresh auth token after signup: `await user.getIdToken(true)`
- Properly unsubscribe from Firestore listeners in useEffect cleanup functions

## Firebase Best Practices
- Use subcollections for user-specific data (friend_requests, notifications, etc.)
- Properly detach Firestore listeners when components unmount
- Check for existing data before creating/updating documents to prevent duplicates
- Implement proper security rules for all collections and subcollections
- Use batched writes or transactions for related operations
- Handle concurrent modification with optimistic UI updates

## Path Aliases
The project uses path aliases for cleaner imports:
- `@/*` - Root directory
- `@app/*` - App directory
- `@auth/*` - Auth components
- `@components/*` - UI components
- `@assets/*` - Images and icons
- `@lib/*` - Utility functions
- `@public/*` - Public assets
- `@context/*` - React context files

## Project Structure
- App Router-based organization with route groups: `(auth)`, `(user)`, etc.
- User-specific pages under `app/(user)/[username]/` with shared components
- UI components in `/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui based components)
- Firebase utilities in `/app/lib/firebaseConfig.ts` with context providers in `/context/`
- Type definitions in `/types/` directory

## Firebase Rules
- Firestore rules in `.firestore-rules` - enforce viewer/editor permission model
- Storage rules in `storage.rules` - manage access to profile and children photos
- All operations require authentication by default
- Children data access controlled by viewers/editors arrays in child documents
- The `change_history` subcollection requires special rules allowing editors to read history entries
- Private events only visible to creators
- Expense groups can be shared or private

### Firestore Rule for change_history Subcollection
```
match /children/{childId} {
  // Main document rules here...
  
  // Change history subcollection
  match /change_history/{historyId} {
    allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                (resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid || 
                 get(/databases/$(database)/documents/children/$(childId)).data.editors.hasAny([request.auth.uid]));
    // Only system operations can write to history (client-side writes are not allowed)
    allow write: if false;
  }
}
